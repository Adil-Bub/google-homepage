This was my very first experience in writing a full fledged html code. 
I'm genuinly glad with how the whole thing turned out. The css really showed it's true capibilities. 
Being an amature, at first I was almost overwhelmed by the whole html css javascript thing.
But with trial and error, it all seemed to come together.
The course just before this on freecodecamp actually helped me a lot in understanding the true basics of web-development.
And let me be clear, it took me two days to get this done, to a point where I'm mostly satisfied. So it did take time.
A lot of help was required, googling certain keywords seemed to open a new window of thoughts and processes. At some point, I even started questioning my life choices. 
Take as much of help as you can from youtube, google, or any forum that you can find. 

And I have basically cloned the homepage of google and bypassed the search query such that it would actually make a google search and hence you can perforn normal searches to open the same results as you would on google.com.

Special thanks to my brother Saad, for extensively helping me out with this one.
